<p id="hd">With CSS, you can control the color,
 font, the size of text, the spacing between 
elements, how elements are positioned and laid 
out, what background images or background colors
are to be used, different displays for different
devices and screen sizes, and much more.
<br>
<p>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep
 the styles in external CSS files. However, 
in this tutorial we will use inline and internal
 styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, 
and easier for you to try it yourself.

<div class="center">The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.
The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
