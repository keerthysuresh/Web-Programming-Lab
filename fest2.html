<p><i><h3 style="color:#6F124D;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;">The festival of 
Onam is celebrated throughout the state of Kerala. Kerala during Onam is marked by happiness, 
excitement and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is celebrated as an outcome of reasons 
that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarian practices. If one is to go by the myth, 
then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and virtuous ruler, 
who had once ruled Kerala.</h3></p></i>
