Fruits and vegetables are a great source of vitamins and minerals. 
You wonâ€™t find a better nutritional source than fruits and veggies, which are packed with vitamins A, C and E,
 as well as magnesium, zinc, phosphorous and folic acid. For potassium, one of the most important minerals for your health, 
eat plenty of avocados, sweet potatoes, bananas, prunes and even tomato paste puree.
