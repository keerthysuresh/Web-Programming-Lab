<h2>HUT</h2>
<center>
<p>A hut is a small dwelling, which may be constructed of various
local materials. Huts are a type of vernacular architecture
because they are built of readily available materials such as
wood, snow, ice, stone, grass, palm leaves, branches, hides, fabric, 
or mud using techniques passed down through the generations.
